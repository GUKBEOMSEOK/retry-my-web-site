<h2>Baseball</h2> 
Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding.<br> 
The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning 
when a player on the fielding team,<br>called the pitcher,
throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat.
<br><p>The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, 
away from the other team's players,<br>allowing its players to run the bases, 
having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 
<br>The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters 
from becoming runners,<br>and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.</p>
